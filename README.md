AMR project

Simulate a locomotion on a flat surface using an MPC controller 
The project should implement mpc controller as suggested in the paper

### Install using pip

```bash
pip install dartpy casadi scipy matplotlib osqp

```

## Run the simulation
```
python3 project/simulation.py
```
then press spacebar to start it
